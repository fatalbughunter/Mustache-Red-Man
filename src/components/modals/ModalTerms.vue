If coverage of a match is abandoned or interrupted but the match proceeds normally, the relevant Markets will be settled according to the relevant results as officially reported.</p>
                
                <p class="section-number">11.5.</p>
                <p>If a match deviates significantly from the generally accepted format or rules, Tachebet reserves the right to void any relevant Market.</p>
                
                <p class="section-number">11.6.</p>
                <p>If a match is not completed or not played (e.g. through disqualification, interruption, withdrawal, changes in draws, etc.), all undecided Markets will be void. However if the outcome of the Market has already been determined then the Market will be settled accordingly.</p>
                
                <p class="section-number">11.7.</p>
                <p>If the outcome of a Market was already known or decided before the placing of a bet, the bet will be void and any winnings may be withheld or deducted and wager amounts returned.</p>
                
                <p class="section-number">11.8.</p>
                <p>Betting may be voided in the case of any incorrectly displayed or calculated prices.</p>
                
                <p class="section-number">11.9.</p>
                <p>Bets are void on postponed, cancelled, or abandoned Matches. Matches which have their start date altered well in advance to accommodate live TV, or to ease fixture congestion will not be classed as postponed. An abandonment is where a match is halted before the completion of the allocated match time and not played out to conclusion on the same day. Markets which have already been determined at the time of abandonment, such as 'First Team to Score', will stand. The Market must be fully determined for bets to stand.</p>
                
                <p class="section-number">11.10.</p>
                <p>If a Market is incorrectly settled, Tachebet reserves the right to correct it at any time.</p>
                
                <p class="section-number">11.11.</p>
                <p>For prop bets, the following terminology applies:</p>
                <p>"Player must play": applies to all pre-match player prop markets across NBA, NHL, NFL, CBB, and CFB and all in-play player prop markets across MLB, NBA and NFL.</p>
                <p>"Player must start": all prematch MLB player prop markets (pitcher and batter markets) are "Player must start". Bench player markets are not available for pre-match betting. NHL goalie markets are "Goalie Must Start".</p>
                
                <p class="section-number">11.12.</p>
                <p>The following rules apply to prop bets:</p>
                <p>Tachebet reserves the right to void bets placed on known outcomes or known results.</p>
                <p>Settlements are sourced from the official league data in the box scores: nfl.com, nba.com, mlb.com, and nhl.com.</p>
                <p>Bets are void on postponed, cancelled, or abandoned matches.</p>
                
                <p class="section-number">11.13.</p>
                <p>"Cash Out" is a feature that offers the customer the opportunity to take a return on a bet placed before the bet has reached its conclusion. To Cash Out (where available), click on the Cash Out button next to your bet. The Cash Out amount will then be credited to your account. Once you have chosen to Cash Out, your bet will be deemed concluded and will be unaffected by the final outcome of the relevant event.</p>
                
                <p class="section-number">11.14.</p>
                <p>The following also applies to the Cash Out feature:</p>
                <p>(a) Cash Out will not be available on certain Markets and events.</p>
                <p>(b) A time delay is applied on every Cash Out.</p>
                <p>(c) Cash Out will not be available if the event and/or Market you have placed a bet on is suspended.</p>
                <p>(d) A Cash Out attempt may not be successful if a Market or event is suspended or odds change during the time delay period applied after Cash Out is attempted.</p>
                <p>(e) Where Cash Out is available on a pre-match event, if we do not cover the event live then Cash Out will be unavailable once the event starts.</p>
                <p>(f) Your Cash Out value will differ depending on how your selection is performing and may be higher or lower than your original stake.</p>
                <p>(g) Tachebet reserves the right to reverse the settlement of a Cash Out on any bet that has been settled in error.</p>
                <p>(h) Tachebet will not be responsible in the event that Cash Out is unavailable because of technical issues. Any bets will be settled as normal based on the final result.</p>
                <p>(i) Tachebet reserves the right to remove a customer's ability to use the Cash Out feature, or to nullify any use of such feature, in the event of misuse or any other breaches of these Terms of Service.</p>
